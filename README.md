## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> "Build a simple, single-page website called "Shutdown Clock". The design should feel clean and official, similar to a government site, but with small humorous undertones that make visitors smile.

Page requirements:
	‚Ä¢	A large headline at the top: "The Government Has Been Shut Down For:"
	‚Ä¢	A live counter that shows the exact number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds since the shutdown start date (set this with an environment variable so it can be updated easily).
	‚Ä¢	A bold, serious-looking subtitle under the counter: "This information is provided for public awareness."
	‚Ä¢	Add a thin red banner across the top that says "OFFICIAL NOTICE" in all caps.

Engagement section:
	‚Ä¢	Include a form titled "Report Your Shutdown Survival Tactics" with fields for:
	‚Ä¢	Name
	‚Ä¢	Location (City, State)
	‚Ä¢	What you are doing while the government is closed (text area, max 200 characters)
	‚Ä¢	Submissions should be displayed below the form in a list titled "Citizen Reports" with the name, location, and response.
	‚Ä¢	Add a small disclaimer under the form: "This is not an actual government service. But your input may provide comic relief."

Styling:
	‚Ä¢	Use a professional, government-style serif font for headings and a clean sans-serif for body text.
	‚Ä¢	Stick to a palette of dark blue, white, and red accents.
	‚Ä¢	Make the layout responsive and mobile-friendly.

Extra touches:
	‚Ä¢	Add a share button to post the counter link on X (Twitter) and Facebook.
	‚Ä¢	Include a small footer that says: "Not affiliated with any government agency. But maybe we should be.""
